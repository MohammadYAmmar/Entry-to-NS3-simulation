> ubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso

2 - Download Oracle VM VirtualBox from [link](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

3 - Install Oracle VM VirtualBox 

4 - Install Ubuntu 16.04.4  in VirtualBox
> If the system options do not appear to you with 64 bit architecture, you must activate Virtualization from the BIOS

5 - From Ubuntu: Download the ns3 tool version 3.25 from [link](https://www.nsnam.org/releases/ns-3-25/download/)

6  - Move the file to Desktop or any plase you want, then click on right press in mouse to option [ open in Terminal ]

8 - Open the folder and bulid  the tool

      cd ns-allinone-3.27/
    
     ./build.py --enable-examples --enable-tests
     
   Congratulations üéâ! The tool has been installed after waiting for the installation ‚è∞
   
   
## Hello simulator

To make sure the tool works, it is possible to try the simple example, but this time it is not Hello world, but Hello simulator üòé

    cd ns-3.25/
    
    ./waf --run hello-simulator

This will print the hello Simulator which indicates that ns3 is installed successfully.

You are ready to understand how to run examples! ‚ú®

## Running examples included with the tool

The team has made an illustration of the scientific one as follows:


Whereas, the files, whether in the C ++ language or Python in order to play them, must be copied to the Scratch folder at the beginning!

After that, to run in a graphical manner, write the command as follows

    ./waf --run scratch/[program]  --vis

We will continue the rest after the discussion today üîú
